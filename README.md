Analyzing Chess Games 

Objective: 
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of 20,000 chess games from Lichess.org to uncover insights into player performance, game duration, and opening strategies for both black and white players. As a chess enthusiast, I am particularly interested in exploring how different strategies and factors such as time control, player ratings, and move sequences impact the outcome of a game. By applying data science techniques, the project will provide a deeper understanding of the correlations between player choices and game results. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance both my understanding of chess and my ability to apply machine learning to real-world problems. The findings from this analysis could also help players refine their strategies and improve performance based on data driven insights.

Dataset:  
The dataset for this project comes from Lichess.org, a popular platform for online chess games. It contains 20,000 chess games played by various users, and it includes the following key features:
	Game metadata (player ratings, time control, etc.)
	Game outcome (win/loss/draw)
	Opening strategies used by both players (e.g., King's Gambit, Sicilian Defense)
	Move sequences (which moves were made during the game)
	Game duration (time taken by each player to make all their moves)

This dataset is ideal for studying chess patterns and performance due to its size and the diversity of games, from beginners to advanced players.

Methodology:  
1. Data Preprocessing:  
    Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant or redundant information.  
    Converting timestamps for game start and end times to calculate game duration.  
    Extracting relevant features, such as opening strategy and time control.  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
    Investigating correlations between player rating, opening choice, and game outcomes.  
    Identifying patterns in game duration and its impact on the outcome (win/loss/draw).  
    Visualizing common opening strategies and their effectiveness.  

3. Feature Engineering & Modeling:  
    Applying machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) to predict the outcome of a game based on player ratings, time control, and opening strategies.  
    Evaluating the model performance through cross validation and hyper parameter tuning.  

4. Insights and Conclusions:  
    Drawing insights from the analysis about how various factors affect chess game outcomes.  
    Suggesting strategies for players based on data driven findings.  

Expected Outcomes:  
By the end of the project, we expect to have identified key patterns and insights that can help chess players understand the dynamics of their games better. The analysis will highlight which opening strategies are most effective at different levels of play, how time control influences player behavior, and how ratings impact decision-making during games. These findings can be useful for players looking to improve their strategies or for chess enthusiasts curious about the underlying patterns in professional and amateur play.
